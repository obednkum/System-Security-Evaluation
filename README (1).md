# System-Security-Evaluation

## Objective


The Lab project is aimed to assess and address gaps in an organization's security framework, focusing on implementing role-based access control, multifactor authentication, continuous monitoring, and comprehensive risk assessment to enhance overall cybersecurity posture and achieve compliance with regulatory standards such as PCI DSS.

### Skills Learned


- Security Framework Analysis: Identified and evaluated gaps in an organization's security posture, including role-based access, encryption, and endpoint protection.
- Control Implementation: Applied least privilege principles, developed action plans for remediation, and implemented continuous monitoring strategies.
- Risk Management: Conductred risk assessments and crafted risk response plans aligned with NIST guidelines to prioritize remediation efforts and manage organizational risk effectively. 
- Regulatory Compliance: Gained proficiency in PCI DSS and other compliance requirements, including firewall configurations, antivirus protection, and policy enforcement.
- Collaborative Communication: Presented findings through structured reports and policy documents, enhancing team understanding of security principles and remediation strategies.

### Tools Used


- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
